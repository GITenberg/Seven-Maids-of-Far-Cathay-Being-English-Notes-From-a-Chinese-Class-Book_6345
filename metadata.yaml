description: The English notes which go to make up this Chinese class book are the
  result of a game which the president of the Woman's Anglo-Chinese College of Neuchang,
  China, induced the seven Chinese girls of the graduating class to play during the
  last six months of their college course. The notes were read aloud in class, taken
  down by a stenographer, and afterwards arranged alphabetically by the biographer
  assisted by the president of the college.
